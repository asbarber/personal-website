Write a program that simulates rolling two dice, allows two users to guess the product the two dice, and prints which user was closer.

Assume there are two dice that contain values from 1 to 6.
Assume the players are called player1 and player2.
Print the player who guessed closer to the product (or print that there was a tie).

Grammar Note: "dice" is actually plural and the singular of "dice" is actually "die". For understanding purposes, I used "dice" to mean both plural and singular

Random:
To complete this problem, we need to simulate randomness. I advise using the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/">rand()</a> function. To use rand, you must seed it first (typically you would seed based on the time to obtain true random sequences, but we use a constant number to provide the same random sequence).
