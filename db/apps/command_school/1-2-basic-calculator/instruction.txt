Write a program to act as a basic calculator.

Your calculator should allow users to enter one simple expression. An expression is defined as:
<b><i>lhs operator rhs</i></b>

<b>lhs</b> is the left-hand-side number in the expression
<b>rhs</b> is the right-hand-side number in the expression
<b>operator</b> is a simple arithmetic operation; our calculator supports <b>+, -, /, *</b>
 
The following expressions are valid:
<pre>
1 + 2
-1.2 - 2
2.5 * 10
1.0 / 2
</pre>

If the user enters an invalid expression, warn the user of their mistake.
